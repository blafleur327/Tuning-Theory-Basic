  <p>This page is intented to demonstrate recursive application of a single Just-Intonation (JI) interval. Apart from ratios that correspond with powers of 2, ie. 2:1,  4:2, 8:1 etc. no recursive application closes the octave. </p>
  <p>The most famous example is the Pythagorean Comma, attained by recursive application of 12 3:2 P5ths. (3:2)<sup>12</sup> is approximately 1223.46cET, exceeding the octave by 23.46cET.</p>
